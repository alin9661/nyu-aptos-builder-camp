WALLET SECURITY GUIDE
Understanding Your Aptos Wallet

This guide will help you understand how your Aptos wallet works and how we keep it secure.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IS A CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLET?

A cryptocurrency wallet is like a digital bank account that allows you to:
- Store and manage your digital assets (APT tokens)
- Send and receive transactions on the blockchain
- Interact with smart contracts and applications
- Prove ownership and sign transactions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PUBLIC VS PRIVATE KEYS

📍 PUBLIC KEY (ADDRESS)
Like your bank account number - safe to share with anyone.
{{walletAddress}}

🔑 PRIVATE KEY
Like your PIN code - must NEVER be shared with anyone.
We securely manage this for you.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HOW WE SECURE YOUR WALLET

Your wallet is protected with enterprise-grade security:

✓ AES-256-GCM Encryption: Military-grade encryption protects your private key
✓ Secure Storage: Private keys are stored in encrypted databases with restricted access
✓ Access Control: Only you can authorize transactions through your NYU SSO login
✓ Audit Logging: All wallet operations are logged for security monitoring
✓ Regular Backups: Encrypted backups ensure your wallet can be recovered

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO

✅ YOU CAN:
- View your wallet address and balance anytime
- Sign transactions through the NYU Nexus platform
- Participate in governance and reimbursements
- View your transaction history on the blockchain explorer

❌ YOU CANNOT:
- Export or view your private key (for security reasons)
- Use this wallet in external applications or wallets
- Manually approve transactions outside our platform

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ACCOUNT RECOVERY

Good news: Since we manage your wallet, you don't need to worry about losing your private keys!

As long as you can access your NYU SSO account, you can access your wallet. If you lose access to your NYU account, contact NYU IT services for account recovery.
