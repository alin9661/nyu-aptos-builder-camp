/**
 * Integration tests for treasury routes
 *
 * TEMPLATE: Follow the pattern from auth.test.ts
 *
 * Tests to implement:
 *
 * 1. GET /api/treasury/balance
 *    - Should fetch current vault balance
 *    - Should format balance correctly
 *    - Should handle errors from blockchain
 *
 * 2. GET /api/treasury/transactions
 *    - Should return paginated transaction list
 *    - Should respect pagination parameters
 *    - Should sort transactions correctly
 *    - Should filter by transaction type if provided
 *
 * 3. GET /api/treasury/stats
 *    - Should return aggregated statistics
 *    - Should calculate sponsor vs merch totals
 *    - Should include reimbursement stats
 *
 * 4. GET /api/reimbursements
 *    - Should return all reimbursement requests
 *    - Should support pagination
 *    - Should include user display names
 *    - Should filter by status if provided
 *
 * 5. GET /api/reimbursements/:id
 *    - Should return specific reimbursement details
 *    - Should include approvals
 *    - Should include invoice metadata
 *    - Should return 404 for non-existent ID
 *
 * 6. POST /api/reimbursements/submit (authenticated)
 *    - Should accept transaction hash
 *    - Should wait for transaction confirmation
 *    - Should return 401 without authentication
 *    - Should return 400 for invalid transaction hash
 *
 * 7. POST /api/reimbursements/:id/approve (authenticated, leadership only)
 *    - Should accept approval transaction hash
 *    - Should require leadership role
 *    - Should return 401 without authentication
 *    - Should return 403 for non-leadership users
 *
 * Setup:
 * - Use clearDatabase() before each test
 * - Seed test users with different roles
 * - Seed treasury deposits and reimbursements
 * - Mock Aptos SDK responses for blockchain calls
 * - Use API helper for authenticated requests
 *
 * Mocks needed:
 * - aptos.view() for balance queries
 * - aptos.waitForTransaction() for transaction confirmation
 * - Database queries for transactions and reimbursements
